### 👋 Hi there! I'm not John Doe


I’m a passionate software developer specializing in mobile app development with over 2 years of experience. I enjoy building cross-platform apps using Flutter and contributing to open-source projects.

🔧 **Technologies I work with:**
- Flutter, Dart
- Node.js, Firebase
- Docker, Postman

🌱 **Currently Learning and Exploring:**
- I’m currently learning Flutter(For 3 years)
- Building smarter, AI-driven mobile experiences 📱✨

⚡️ **Fun Fact**: I'm a huge fan of retro video games 🎮 and when I'm not coding, you'll probably find me trying to beat the high score on an arcade machine. Or drinking way too much coffee. ☕️
